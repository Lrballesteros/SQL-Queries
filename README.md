# SQL-Queries
PostgresSQL queries I learned during a bootcamp.

This is my first README. I've seen maybe one or two in my whole life. Thank you for giving this message an
opportunity to be read. Nothing spectacular here, but thank you again. I have no coding experience,
so I took some stuff I learned and threw it in here. Hopefully it can impress someone, because though I 
am not an expert, I am eager to learn, even outside of work. My mind is always trying to understanding
a bit everything around me. I am proactive and will do my best to keep working on skills while I keep applying to 
junior level jobs.
